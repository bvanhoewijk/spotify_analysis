disquiet playing such eerie harmonies Making waves and diving under Lightning to the sound of thunder My dark disquiet singing such haunting melodies So white, so still, so bright, it's almost too painful now I'm ready to fight, to run from the light And here now comes the sweet corrupting reality While now I'm free, will I once cease to be Will I awake, will I get a ride with you In this race of two We are momentary masters We're false kings and bastards Without names we're fantasizing Dancing like flames, mesmerizing My dark disquiet playing such eerie harmonies Making waves and diving under Lightning to the sound of thunder My dark disquiet singing such haunting melodies We are marionettes by strings animated Yet like lovers of strings liberated We are marionettes by strings animated Yet like lovers of strings liberated Without names we're fantasizing Without names we're fantasizing Dancing like flames, mesmerizing My dark disquiet playing such eerie harmonies Making

came here Heroes of the dawn As they showed that all love Doesn't fall from above But is found Like comfort in a storm But their magic wasn't meant to last Vile envy lurking every now and then As they burnt too bright and burnt too fast In the eyes of other men And the waves crowned with the whitest laces Soon the grave for these beautiful minds All the folks would talk as now are gone The last ones of their kind Green were the meadows, the forests But the oceans carried a greater promise Without highs, without lows Without dreams left to sow Till they came here Heroes of the dawn As they showed that all love Doesn't fall from above But is found Like comfort in a storm Because the crown they defied Sentenced without a trial If you listen at dawn They still sing with the sun Their legend belongs to the light As they showed that all love Doesn't fall from above But remains In corners of the heart Without highs, without lows Without dreams left to sow Till they came here Heroes

Was there all that much to gain?

carried them When we finally got it figured out that we had truly missed the boat Oh, and we carried it all so well As if we got a new position Oh, and we owned all the tools ourselves But not the

With a million lies the truth will rise to tear you apart. Wooaahh! No one gets out alive, every day is do or die. The one thing you leave behind... Is how did you love, how did you love? It's not what you believe; those prayers will make you bleed. But while you're on your knees... How did you love, how did you love, how did you love? Nothing ever feels the quite same when you are what you dreamed. And you will never look at anything the same when you see what I see How we forget ourselves, loose our way from the cradle to the grave You can't replicate or duplicate, gotta find your own way. Wooaahh! No one gets out alive, every day is do or die. The one thing you leave behind... Is how did you love, how did you love? It's not what you believe; those prayers will make you bleed. But while you're on your knees... How did you love, how did you love, how did you love? This ain't no cross to carry. We are the judge and jury; we are the judge and jury... No one gets out alive, every day is do or die. The one thing you leave behind... Is how did you love, how did you love? It's not what you believe; those prayers will make you bleed. But while you're on your knees... How did you love, how did you love, how did you love? This ain't no cross to carry We are the judge and jury, we are the judge and jury How did you love, how did you love?

So take however long you want, but don't forget my love. You've pledged yourself to come along. You're lost in reveries, holding back the tears. Faint sound of the wires. The butterfly is in the fire now. Lost in a memory you're holding my hands. One heart is in the ground. The other is veiled in silver all around. Born under a troubled sign. Will it hurt to see me find, the long lost peace of mind? Darling, you had me here for a while. It breaks my heart to see you cry.

hunter draws closer to it's prey Vacantly I was gazing at the mirage I yearned to be an apostle Of the selfmade man Hopelessly I bathed in my ignorance Desperately toking on the roach of irony My fickle fortune beckoned A treasure fit for fools The hunter draws closer to it's prey I blindly wandered down the golden path In pursuit of a misbegotten dream The great gatsby whispered in my ears The road from rags to riches leads nowhere The grand illusion beckoned With promises of deceit [Chorus] The Cockroach King sits on his throne With the midas touch and a heart of stone An empire build on guile and greed A bleeding ground for those who heed The grand illusion faded The hunter snares it's prey I fear and loathe the cockroach The mirage melts away [Chorus] The Cockroach King sits on his throne With the midas touch and a heart of stone An empire build on guile and greed A bleeding ground for those who heed Lured by a treasure that was fit for fools \"Searching for the truth\" Lost in this labyrinth in search of the truth \"With your promises of deceit\" Trapped in your kingdom build on greed and guile \"Build on greed and guile\" Only to find the insects have multiplied [Chorus] The Cockroach King of guile and greed With a broken crown he's left to bleed An empire falling to it's knees A bleeding ground for those who heed I longed to be a disciple of the cockroach I was hopelessly choking On the roach of fallacy \"The roach of irony\" Thankfully when the mirage finally melted The impurity of the cockroach was revealed to me \"The roach of irony\" Blinded by the

but she won't get far I'm on a show to parole to the toad in a hole I've gotta grow some roots, gotta prop up the bar I've got bloodshot eyes and there's blood in my teeth I've got a ripped up jacket and a friend who's a thief Well I'm a coughing out my mouth, trying to pull it out But the fire inside keeps burning, burning out Cos i'm a sad sack, post teen, could have been a love machine, no

Oh the dreamers may die, but the dreams live on Dreams live on Dreams live on Now a shadow on a hill, the angel of the east The empire of the clouds may rest in peace And in a country churchyard, laid head to the mast Eight and forty souls, who came to die in France", "audio_features": [{"danceability": 0.249, "energy": 0.789, "key": 4, "loudness": -6.15, "mode": 0, "speechiness": 0.0496, "acousticness": 0.0165, "instrumentalness": 0.00239, "liveness": 0.104, "valence": 0.19, "tempo": 76.293, "type": "audio_features", "id": "7C6K5CQkYOqCS1qcmGUQfV", "uri": "spotify:track:7C6K5CQkYOqCS1qcmGUQfV", "track_href": "https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/7C6K5CQkYOqCS1qcmGUQfV", "analysis_url": "https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-analysis/7C6K5CQkYOqCS1qcmGUQfV", "duration_ms": 1081316, "time_signature": 4}]}, {"added_at": "2016-12-19T21:04:22Z", "name": "Angry Animals", "artist": "Engine Three Seven", "artist_id": "3zbZ1Yfr2gcBQAjjYGeS9G", "genres": "progressive alternative", "uri": "spotify:track:5BrISbrni9D0BhuRGc9VxY", "lyrics": "", "audio_features": [{"danceability": 0.554, "energy": 0.968, "key": 4, "loudness": -3.918, "mode": 0, "speechiness": 0.114, "acousticness": 7.51e-05, "instrumentalness": 0.000436, "liveness": 0.0866, "valence": 0.232, "tempo": 110.011, "type": "audio_features", "id": "5BrISbrni9D0BhuRGc9VxY", "uri": "spotify:track:5BrISbrni9D0BhuRGc9VxY", "track_href": "https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/5BrISbrni9D0BhuRGc9VxY", "analysis_url": "https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-analysis/5BrISbrni9D0BhuRGc9VxY", "duration_ms": 195374, "time_signature": 3}]}, {"added_at": "2016-12-19T21:04:07Z", "name": "Burn Brighter", "artist": "Lansdowne", "artist_id": "5urnoBZifR5YXG5YdCOj34", "genres": "gymcore,hard alternative,post-screamo", "uri": "spotify:track:6BUMVGOnIeOIE6YetJGGDT", "lyrics": "Uh oh Here we go Hit another crossroad Better make it count cause you never really know Built up Broke down Sick of being pushed around You want it, you got it Because the time is right now.

fears have been sta ring at all my doubts Nobody cares if you're standing or lying down When all you had is taken away Run it So give me the song and I swear that I'll sing it Like never before All of my life I have watched this moment Go right through the door So don't you save a single breath For me when I'm gone 'Cause there will be no lungs inside my chest And nothing inside of my heart Nothing inside of my heart All the dreams I had are clawing like a hand around my throat There will be a crown upon my head There will be a crown upon me", "audio_features": [{"danceability": 0.474, "energy":

grows Hear my words that I might teach you Take my arms that I might reach to you\" But my words like silent raindrops fell And echoed in the wells of silence And the people bowed and prayed To the

And on my deathbed I will pray to the gods and the angels, Like a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven; To a place I recall, I was there so long ago. The sky was bruised, the wine was bled, and there you led me on. In your house I long to be; Room by room, patiently, I'll wait for you there like a stone. I'll wait for you there alone, alone. And on I read until the day was gone; And I sat in regret of all the things I've done; For all that I've blessed, and all that I've wronged. In dreams until my death I will wander on.

He wanted to change the world, to make it all worthwhile. So he put his pen to paper and poured out everything inside. He's read the scene and unpacked the man that he had became. So leave him trailing on the fasttrack to falling into his grave. I've never been so torn up in all of my life, I should of seen this coming. I've never felt so hopeless, Than I do tonight. I don't wanna do this anymore, I'm moving on. I can't believe I've come so far in such a time, And I'm still fighting on my own. I fucked up to catch my breath I may never breathe again, so just notice: I've never been so torn up in all of my life, I can't believe I let myself breakdown. I've never been so torn up in all of my life, I should of seen this coming. I've never felt so hopeless, Than I do tonight. I don't wanna do this anymore... I've never been so torn up in all of my life, I should of seen this coming. I've never felt so hopeless, Than I do tonight. No I don't wanna do this anymore, I'm moving on. A boy of anguish now, he's a man of soul, Traded in his misery for the lonely life of the road.

Making you unconscious So afraid of failure Nothing ever makes you feel safe I'm complicated (I'm not like you) You can not force me Can not force me I'm complicated I'm not like you You can not force me into your shoes You try to act so perfect But I see the truth in your eyes Why are you here to bleed me dry?

His reign of terror, Will cost many a sacrifice, An inferno is at hand! All through the centuries, Men will be caged, In the name of liberty! As long as man shall live, Wars will be waged, Or will we ever be set free? WOMEN: Set me free! AYREON: Ooh... WOMEN: Set me free! AYREON: Pray god almighty! Set me free! Set me free! WOMEN: Set me free! AYREON: Set me free, oh lord! WOMEN: Set me free! AYREON: I'm begging you, I'm begging thee, just to set me free! WOMEN: Oh! Ayreon: The road to ruin Gets shorter all the time, As technology will improve. It takes but one man, To commit the ultimate crime, And make the final move! All through the ages, Men will die before their time, In an everlasting war! As long as man shall live, Wars will be waged! Or will we ever, will we ever be set free? WOMEN: Set me free! AYREON: Ooh... WOMEN: Set me free! AYREON: Pray god almighty! Set me free! Set me free! WOMEN: Set me free! AYREON: Set me, set me free, oh lord! WOMEN: Set me free!
